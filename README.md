# **UBUNTU INSTALLATION GUIDE:**

## Installing Composer

1. First, install Composer by following the steps provided in this guide: [How to Install and Use Composer on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-composer-on-ubuntu-20-04).

2. After successfully installing Composer, open your terminal.

3. Use the following command to install the required packages for your project. This command will also ignore the platform requirement for `ext-mysqli`, which can be useful in some cases:

    ```shell
    composer install --ignore-platform-req=ext-mysqli
    ```

4. If you encounter any issues related to missing PHP extensions, you can try installing them with the following commands:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install php-mysqlnd
    sudo apt install php-xml
    ```
